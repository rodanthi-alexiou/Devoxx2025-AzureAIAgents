      "1. **Parties Involved**: The contract identifies the seller and buyer involved in the transaction. For example, in a specific Maryland contract, the seller is an individual (Anne Patel) and the buyer (Oscar Ward).\n",

      "2. **Property Description**: The contract will include details about the property being sold, including its address and specifics about the property type.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Contingencies**: Many contracts include conditions that must be met for the sale to proceed. Common contingencies involve financing approval, home inspections, and appraisal results.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Closing Process**: The contract outlines when the sale will be finalized (the closing), what documents will be exchanged, and any obligations both parties have leading up to and on the closing date.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Rights and Responsibilities**: The contract defines the rights and responsibilities of each party, including disclosures that the seller must make about the property, such as environmental hazards or existing conditions (like flooding history).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Entire Agreement Clause**: The contract typically states that it constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and can only be modified in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Legal Enforceability**: This agreement is significant as it creates legal obligations and, if either party fails to comply, it may lead to default or legal action.\n",
