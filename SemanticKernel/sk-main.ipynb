    "## What is Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel is a model-agnostic SDK that empowers developers to build, orchestrate, and deploy AI agents and multi-agent systems. Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex multi-agent workflow, Semantic Kernel provides the tools you need with enterprise-grade reliability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python**: 3.10+\n",
    "- **.NET**: .NET 8.0+ \n",

    "- **OS Support**: Windows, macOS, Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Flexibility**: Connect to any LLM with built-in support for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [NVidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nim-microservices/) and more\n",
    "- **Agent Framework**: Build modular AI agents with access to tools/plugins, memory, and planning capabilities\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Orchestrate complex workflows with collaborating specialist agents\n",
    "- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extend with native code functions, prompt templates, OpenAPI specs, or Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n",
    "- **Vector DB Support**: Seamless integration with [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started), and more\n",
    "- **Multimodal Support**: Process text, vision, and audio inputs\n",
    "- **Local Deployment**: Run with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/), or [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/)\n",
    "- **Process Framework**: Model complex business processes with a structured workflow approach\n",
    "- **Enterprise Ready**: Built for observability, security, and stable APIs\n",
